## Featured Tool: KickerzOyaled (AI Chat Bot)

**KickerzOyaled** is an advanced, interactive bot that allows you to automate and enhance your presence in any Kick channel's chat. After a one-time login, you gain access to a powerful control menu in your terminal to switch between various chatting modes on the fly.

### KickerzOyaled Features:

-   **ü§ñ Interactive Control Menu**: No more restarting the script! Log in once and switch between modes from a clean terminal interface.
-   **üß† AI-Powered Chatting (Gemini)**:
    -   **Vision Analyst**: Takes a screenshot of the live stream and uses AI to generate relevant, engaging comments.
    -   **AI Hype Train**: Automatically generates a hype message based on the stream's content and spams it.
-   **üî• Multiple Chatting Modes**:
    -   Manual, File-Based (Sequential or Random), Question Asker, Emoji Spammer, and Hype Train modes.
-   **üîÑ Fully Automated Mode**: Pre-select a playlist of your favorite modes (including AI modes) and let the bot run them continuously and randomly.
-   **üõ†Ô∏è Channel Utilities**: Easily follow, unfollow, or run chat commands like `!uptime`.
-   **üîí Setup Helper**: If you haven't hardcoded your credentials, the bot will safely prompt you for them at runtime.

## Getting Started with KickerzOyaled

Follow these instructions to set up and run the **KickerzOyaled** chat bot.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9 or higher
-   `pip` (Python package installer)
-   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/KickerzOyaled.git
    cd KickerzOyaled
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the project folder and paste the following lines into it:

    ```    botasaurus
    google-genai
    botasaurus
    mailtm
    colorama
    ```

    Now, install all of them with a single command:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration & Running

1.  **Set Credentials (Optional but Recommended):**
    Open `KickerzOyaled.py` and edit the following lines with your account details. This saves you from entering them every time.
    ```python
    # --- DEFAULT CREDENTIALS (REPLACE OR ENTER AT PROMPT) ---
    USERNAME = "your-kick-username"
    PASSWORD = "your-kick-password"
    EMAIL = "your_login_email@domain.com" # For automatic OTP
    EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_email_password" # For automatic OTP
    ```
    If you leave these as default, the script will prompt you to enter them when it runs.

2.  **Prepare Content Files (Optional):**
    -   Create `messages.txt` and add any messages you want the File-Based Chatter to use, one per line.
    -   Create `questions.txt` and add any questions you want the Question Asker to use, one per line.

3.  **Run the Bot:**
    Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python KickerzOyaled.py
    ```

4.  **First-Time AI Setup:**
    The first time you select an AI-powered mode (`A`, `5` with AI, or `M` with AI), the script will prompt you to enter your **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). The bot will remember the key for the rest of the session.

## Developer's Log

*(Huge shoutout to that homie on reddit for recommending me this library, goated individual. Anyways, this is far easier than I thought. My stuff ain't THERE yet, but I'm just fucking around, and if it's that easy to create a script to automate accounts, then the all-in-one tool might come sooner rather than later. No way botting services charge you astronomical amounts of money for several hours worth of work LMAO)*
